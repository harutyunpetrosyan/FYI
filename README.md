This project is a very simple test automation framework built using Selenium and TestNG to validate key functionality of a web application.
The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, which helps in creating an organized structure by separating the test logic from the web page interactions.
This makes the tests more maintainable and reusable.
Although the project is simple, it effectively demonstrates the power of automation by focusing on core functionality,
such as verifying the correct display of copyright text, checking menu options, testing button redirections, and validating search results.
